Markdown is a simple standard to create formatted documents in plaintext--a lightweight markup language based on how people intuitively write emails. 
Because of it's simplicity, a growing number of websites, note taking apps, publishing systems, and code notebooks use Markdown to format content, making it a powerful, cross-platform option for academic and tech writing. 
This session introduces the basics of writing Markdown, useful applications, and tips for efficient writing.
